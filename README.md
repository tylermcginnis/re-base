# What is re-base?

React.js makes managing state easy to reason about. Firebase makes persisting your data easy to implement. re-base, inspired by Relay, combines the benefits of React and Firebase by allowing each component to specify its own data dependency. Forget about your data persistence and focus on what really matters, your application's state.

# Why re-base?

I spent a few weeks trying to figure out the cleanest way to implement Firebase into my React/Flux application. After struggling for a bit, I [tweeted](https://twitter.com/tylermcginnis33/status/605838057825132549) my frustrations. I was enlightened to the fact that Firebase and Flux really don't work well together. It makes sense why they don't work together, because they're both trying to accomplish roughly the same thing. So I did away with my reliance upon Flux and tried to think of a clean way to implement React with Firebase. I came across ReactFire built by Jacob Wenger at Firebase and loved his idea. Sync a Firebase endpoint with a property on your component's state. So whenever your data changes, your state will be updated. Simple as that. The problem with ReactFire is because it uses Mixins, it's not compatible with ES6 classes. After chatting with Jacob Turner, we wanted to create a way to allow the one way binding of ReactFire with ES6 classes along some more features like two way data binding and listening to Firebase endpoints without actually binding a state property to them. Thus, re-base was built.

# Features

- [*syncState*](#syncstateendpoint-options): Two way data binding between any property on your component's state and any endpoint in Firebase. Use the same API you're used to to update your component's state (setState), and Firebase will also update.
- [*bindToState*](#bindtostateendpoint-options): One way data binding. Whenever your Firebase endpoint changes, the property on your state will update as well.
- [*listenTo*](#listentoendpoint-options): Whenever your Firebase endpoint changes, it will invoke a callback passing it the new data from Firebase.
- [*fetch*](#fetchendpoint-options): Retrieve data from Firebase without setting up any binding or listeners.
- [*post*](#postendpoint-options): Add new data to Firebase.
- [*push*](#pushendpoint-options): Push new child data to Firebase.
- [*update*](#updateendpoint-options): Update child data using only the referenced properties
- [*remove*](#removeendpoint-callback): Remove data from Firebase
- [*removeBinding*](#removebindingref): Remove a Firebase listener before the component unmounts if you need to. (Listeners are automatically cleaned up when component unmounts)
- [*reset*](#reset): Removes all of the Firebase listeners.

# Installing

```bash
$ npm install re-base
```

# API

#### For more in depth examples of the API, see the [`examples`](examples) folder.


## createClass(firebaseDatabase)

##### Purpose
Accepts an initialized firebase database object

##### Arguments
  1. initialized firebase database
    - type: object

##### Return Value
  An instance of re-base.

##### Example using all of firebase

```javascript
var Rebase = require('re-base');
var firebase = require('firebase');
var app = firebase.initializeApp({
      apiKey: "apiKey",
      authDomain: "projectId.firebaseapp.com",
      databaseURL: "https://databaseName.firebaseio.com",
      storageBucket: "bucket.appspot.com",
      messagingSenderId: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
});
var base = Rebase.createClass(app.database());

```

##### Example using only the firebase database component

```javascript
var Rebase = require('re-base');
var firebase = require('firebase/app');
var database = require('firebase/database');
var app = firebase.initializeApp({
      apiKey: "apiKey",
      authDomain: "projectId.firebaseapp.com",
      databaseURL: "https://databaseName.firebaseio.com",
      storageBucket: "bucket.appspot.com",
      messagingSenderId: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
});
var db = database(app);
var base = Rebase.createClass(db);

```

<br />

## initializedApp

##### Purpose
  This property contains the initialized firebase app that was passed into re-base. You can access any of the firebase services that you are using off this object. For instance, if you want to use some firebase `database` methods that re-base doesn't have helpers for or if you are using the `auth` service and want to quickly access it off of re-base.

<br />

## syncState(endpoint, options)

##### Purpose
  Allows you to set up two way data binding between your component's state and your Firebase. Whenever your Firebase changes, your component's state will change. Whenever your component's state changes, Firebase will change.

#### Arguments
  1. endpoint
    - type: string
    - The relative Firebase endpoint to which you'd like to bind your component's state
  2. options
    - type: object
    - properties:
      - context: (object - required) The context of your component
      - state: (string - required) The state property you want to sync with Firebase; can be an arbitrarily nested property a là `foo.bar`
      - defaultValue: (string|boolean|number|object - optional) A default value to set when the Firebase endpoint has no value (i.e., on init) (use this if you want a value other than an empty object or empty array)
      - asArray: (boolean - optional) Returns the Firebase data at the specified endpoint as an Array instead of an Object
      - keepKeys: (boolean - optional) will keep any firebase generated keys intact when manipulating data using the asArray option.
      - queries: (object - optional) Queries to be used with your read operations.  See [Query Options](#queries) for more details.
      - then: (function - optional) The callback function that will be invoked when the initial listener is established with Firebase. Typically used (with syncState) to change `this.state.loading` to false.
      - onFailure: (function - optional) A callback function that will be invoked if the current user does not have read  or write permissions at the location.

#### Return Value
  An object which you can pass to `removeBinding` if you want to remove the listener while the component is still mounted.

#### Example

```javascript
componentDidMount(){
  base.syncState(`shoppingList`, {
    context: this,
    state: 'items',
    asArray: true
  });
}
addItem(newItem){
  this.setState({
    items: this.state.items.concat([newItem]) //updates Firebase and the local state
  });
}
```

<br />

## bindToState(endpoint, options)

#### Purpose
  One way data binding from Firebase to your component's state. Allows you to bind a component's state property to a Firebase endpoint so whenever that Firebase endpoint changes, your component's state will be updated with that change.

#### Arguments
  1. endpoint
    - type: string
    - The relative Firebase endpoint that you'd like to bind to your component's state
  2. options
    - type: object
    - properties:
      - context: (object - required) The context of your component
      - state: (string - required) The state property you want to sync with Firebase; can be an arbitrarily nested property a là `foo.bar` (no arrays)
      - asArray: (boolean - optional) Returns the Firebase data at the specified endpoint as an Array instead of an Object
      - queries: (object - optional) Queries to be used with your read operations.  See [Query Options](#queries) for more details.
      - then: (function - optional) The callback function that will be invoked when the initial listener is established with Firebase. Typically used (with bindToState) to change `this.state.loading` to false.
      - onFailure: (function - optional) A callback function that will be invoked if the current user does not have read permissions at the location.

#### Return Value
  An object which you can pass to `removeBinding` if you want to remove the listener while the component is still mounted.

#### Example

```javascript
componentDidMount(){
  base.bindToState('tasks', {
    context: this,
    state: 'tasks',
    asArray: true
  });
}
```

<br />

## listenTo(endpoint, options)

#### Return Value
  An object which you can pass to `removeBinding` when your component unmounts to remove the Firebase listeners.

#### Example

```javascript
componentDidMount(){
  base.listenTo('votes', {
    context: this,
    asArray: true,
    then(votesData){
      var total = 0;
      votesData.forEach((vote, index) => {
        total += vote
      });
      this.setState({total});
    }
  })
}
```

  }).then(data => {
    console.log(data);
  }).catch(error => {
    //handle error
  })
}
```

<br />

## post(endpoint, options)

#### Purpose
  Allows you to update a Firebase endpoint with new data. *Replace all the data at this endpoint with the new data*

//
addBear(){
  var immediatelyAvailableReference = base.push('bears', {
    data: {name: 'George', type: 'Grizzly'},
    then(err){

## <a name='queries'>Queries</a>

Use the query option to utilize the [Firebase Query](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/firebase.database.Query) API.  For a list of available queries and how they work, see the Firebase docs.

Queries are accepted in the `options` object of each read method (`syncState`, `bindToState`, `listenTo`, and `fetch`).  The object should have one or more keys of the type of query you wish to run, with the value being the value for the query.  For example:

```javascript
base.syncState('users', {
  context: this,
  state: 'users',
  asArray: true,
  queries: {
    orderByChild: 'iq',
    limitToLast: 3
  }
})
```

The binding above will sort the `users` endpoint by iq, retrieve the last three (or, three with highest iq), and bind it to the component's `users` state.  NOTE: This query is happening within Firebase.  The *only* data that will be retrieved are the three users with the highest iq.

## <a name='upgrading'>Upgrading to re-base 3.x from 2.x</a>

### Major Changes: ###

3.x no longer requires you to include the full Firebase SDK in your app. This means that you need to include the parts of Firebase SDK you wish to use and handle initialization of the firebase services in your app instead of re-base doing this for you. re-base only requires you pass it the initialized database service. This also means that the authentication helpers are deprecated and re-base no longer exposes the firebase services.

3.x also removes listeners automatically for you on `componentWillUnmount`
so you don't have to explicitly call `removeBinding`. `removeBinding` is still available if you need to remove a listener while the component is still mounted.
For instance, if you are adding and removing listeners in response to a prop change.

To help with migrating to 3.x please see the [Migration Guide](docs/MIGRATION.md)
for the equivalent Firebase SDK methods to use for the deprecated auth helpers.

Changes your re-base initialization:

**Change** this....
```javascript

var Rebase = require('re-base');
var base = Rebase.createClass({
      apiKey: "apiKey",
      authDomain: "projectId.firebaseapp.com",
      databaseURL: "https://databaseName.firebaseio.com",
      storageBucket: "bucket.appspot.com",
});

```

***To*** this...
```javascript

var Rebase = require('re-base');
var firebase = require('firebase');
var app = firebase.initializeApp({
      apiKey: "apiKey",
      authDomain: "projectId.firebaseapp.com",
      databaseURL: "https://databaseName.firebaseio.com",
      storageBucket: "bucket.appspot.com",
});
var base = Rebase.createClass(app.database());

```

### Changes to Database methods
<hr />

No changes. Your existing code should work.

<br />

### Changes to Authentication methods
<hr />


***Deprecated Methods***

`base.resetPassword`
`base.createUser`
`base.authWithPassword`
`base.authWithCustomToken`
`base.authWithOAuthPopup`
`base.getOAuthRedirectResult`
`base.authWithOAuthToken`
`base.authWithOAuthRedirect`
`base.onAuth`
`base.unauth`
`base.getAuth`
